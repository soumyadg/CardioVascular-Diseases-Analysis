### Introduction

The introduction section provides an overview of the study, including the background, research objectives, and significance of the research topic.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

## A. Data Collection
The data collection procedure for this study involved utilizing the annual BRFSS data in 2021 obtained from the Center for Disease Control (2021). The dataset, which consisted of 438,693 records with a total of 304 attributes, was accessed on a local machine. However, not all attributes were relevant to this particular study. Consequently, a specific subset of 19 attributes was chosen and incorporated into the construction of the machine learning (ML) model to create the predictive model for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This deliberate selection led to a reduction in the number of records, resulting in a total of 308,854 data instances utilized for analysis and model development.

## B. Data Preprocessing
The next step involved preprocessing the data to ensure its readiness for the application of machine learning algorithms. This process entailed performing tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, feature selection, and feature engineering. These measures were taken to optimize the quality and suitability of the data for subsequent analysis and model development.

## C. Model Selection
The next step involved selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) for the data, considering the specific variables being used and the research question being addressed. This decision was made based on careful consideration of the data characteristics and the desired outcomes of the study.

## D. Model Training and Testing
After selecting the machine learning algorithm(s), the data was divided into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The training set consisted of 80% of the data, while the remaining 20% was allocated for testing. The selected machine learning algorithm(s) were trained using the training set and subsequently evaluated using the testing set to evaluate their performance.

## E. Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were employed, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest. These models were selected based on their appropriateness for classification tasks and their capability to handle both numerical and categorical variables.

## F. Evaluation of F1 Scores
To identify the model achieving the best F1 score in predicting CVD risk, a comprehensive evaluation was performed using 10-fold cross-validation. F1 scores, a metric combining precision and recall, were used to assess the models' performance. The mean F1 score for each model was calculated to represent its overall performance.

## G. Hyperparameter Tuning
In the process of identifying impactful personal attributes for predicting CVD risk, the coefficients associated with the best F1 score were analyzed. The magnitude and direction of these coefficients were examined to determine the influence of different personal attributes on the model's predictions. Specifically, the variables "Sex," "Diabetes," and "General Health" were considered. The model was improved through hyperparameter tuning, focusing on the regularization parameter C. GridSearchCV, a technique that systematically tested different values of the hyperparameter, was employed. The values of C evaluated were 0.1, 1, and 10, aiming to identify the optimal setting that enhanced the model's performance.

## H. Identification of Impactful Personal Attributes
The coefficients of the model with the best F1 score were examined to determine the personal attributes that significantly influenced the risk prediction of CVDs. Feature importance was derived from the magnitude and direction of the coefficients. Variables with higher coefficients were considered to have a greater impact on the model's predictions.

## I. Evaluation of Model Performance
The performance of the model with the best F1 score was assessed by examining its ability to correctly classify individuals with CVDs and healthy individuals. A confusion matrix was employed to calculate true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values. Sensitivity (recall) and specificity were derived from these values to determine the model's accuracy.

## J. Assessment of Discrimination Ability
The model's ability to distinguish between classes was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The AUC score quantifies the model's separability in distinguishing healthy individuals from those at risk for CVDs. The methodology employed in this study provided a comprehensive approach to predict CVD risk using machine learning models. By evaluating performance metrics, conducting hyperparameter tuning, analyzing feature importance, and assessing model accuracy and discrimination ability, the study aimed to enhance understanding of the role of personal attributes in predicting CVD risk.

## K. Model evaluation
The final step involved evaluating the performance of the machine learning algorithm(s) using various statistical tools, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics were calculated to assess the performance of the machine learning algorithm(s) on the test data.

### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this study, a series of tests were conducted to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning (ML) models in predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The ML algorithms were implemented on an Intel Core i7 8th generation machine with the Windows 10 operating system, using R Studio and Python with learn packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and Sci-kit learn. The models were trained on a training set and evaluated on a separate test set to assess their performance.

To ensure a balanced evaluation of the models, the F1 score was chosen as the metric, which considers both precision and recall. Cross-validation was employed using a 10-Stratified K-Fold, and the mean F1 score was calculated to represent the overall performance of each model. The ML models used in this study included Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree Classifier (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF).

Table I presents the performance of the ML models using the 10-fold cross-validation and F1 scores as the metric. The mean F1 score for each model is calculated to represent its overall performance. The results in Table I indicate that the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest mean F1 score of 0.32564, followed by K-Nearest Neighbor with a score of 0.27350. Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest models achieved lower F1 scores.

To further analyze the performance of the models, a classification report was generated for the training set, as shown in the tables. The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest F1 score of 0.3257 in the training data. However, it is worth noting that the Decision Tree Classifier achieved a high F1 score of 0.99. Despite this, the Decision Tree model was not considered suitable for this study because the mean F1 score in the cross-validated results differed significantly from the F1 score in the training set, suggesting overfitting.

The researcher then focused on tuning the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model to improve its performance. The hyperparameter tuned was the regularization parameter C, which controls the tradeoff between fitting the training data and model complexity. The GridSearchCV technique was used with three values of C: 0.1, 1, and 10. The mean F1 scores for each C value on the training and test sets are presented in Table VII. The best-performing model was found with C = 0.1, achieving a mean F1 score of 0.3257. Using the Logistic Regression model with the optimal hyperparameter setting (C = 0.1), the classification report for the test set was generated and shown in Table VIII.

The model achieved an F1 score of 0.33, which is consistent with the F1 score obtained in the training data, indicating good generalization ability.

The feature importance analysis provides valuable insights into the variables that significantly contribute to the model's predictions. Among the variables, the categorical variable "Sex" exhibited the highest feature importance. The Logistic Regression model assigns more weight to males compared to females when predicting the risk of CVDs. The variable "Diabetes" also had positive importance, indicating that individuals identified as diabetic are considered at higher risk. Conversely, the variable "General Health" had the highest negative importance, suggesting that individuals reporting poor general health are considered more at risk for CVDs.

Furthermore, the performance of the Logistic Regression model on the unknown data was further examined using a confusion matrix. The model correctly classified 79.18% of individuals with CVDs and 73.46% of healthy individuals, indicating a high level of accuracy in identifying individuals at risk for CVDs and distinguishing them from those who are healthy.

The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was computed as a performance metric for the Logistic Regression model. The AUC value, which measures the degree of separability between classes, was found to be 0.837, indicating that the model is effective in predicting healthy individuals as healthy and individuals at risk for CVDs as being at risk.

Overall, the results demonstrate that the Logistic Regression model, with a tuned hyperparameter C = 0.1, exhibits a good level of performance on the unknown test data. It successfully predicts the risk of CVDs, as indicated by high values of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. The feature importance analysis provides valuable insights into the variables that significantly contribute to the model's predictions, highlighting the importance of sex, diabetes, and general health in assessing the risk of CVDs. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the factors associated with CVD risk and can assist in developing targeted interventions and preventive measures.

### Conclusion
