Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be a leading cause of death globally. Early detection and prevention play a crucial role in reducing the burden of CVDs. The study focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of developing CVDs based on personal lifestyle factors. The dataset used in the study consists of 438,693 records obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2021, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The study addresses the challenge of class imbalance in the dataset by using sampling techniques to balance the data. Performance evaluation of ML models is conducted using 10-Stratified Fold cross-validation testing, and the best-performing model is identified as Logistic Regression (LR) with an F1 score of 0.32564. Hyperparameter tuning is applied to the LR model, resulting in a better F1 score of 0.3257 with C=0.1. Feature importance analysis reveals that sex, diabetes, and general health are the most influential factors for CVD risk prediction.

The LR model is evaluated on the testing data, achieving an F1 score of 0.33. The Confusion Matrix is used to visualize the model's performance, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify 79.18% of people with CVDs and 73.46% of healthy individuals. Additionally, the LR model achieves an AUC score of 0.837, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between classes.

The study highlights the applicability of the Logistic Regression model in the medical field for CVD risk prediction. It also suggests the incorporation of medical attributes to further improve the model's performance. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into predicting CVD risk based on personal attributes.

Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The study concludes that the Logistic Regression (LR) model outperforms other machine learning models in predicting CVD risk based on personal lifestyle factors. It achieves the highest mean F1 score among the evaluated models. The LR model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques, resulting in improved predictive performance. The evaluation on the test data demonstrates the model's consistency and reliability.

Feature importance analysis reveals that sex, diabetes, and general health have significant impacts on CVD risk prediction according to the LR model. The model shows high accuracy in classifying individuals with CVDs and healthy individuals, and its AUC score confirms its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two classes.

The findings of the study have practical implications for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers. The LR model can be incorporated into clinical practice for early detection and personalized interventions. The identified influential personal attributes can guide the development of targeted intervention strategies. The study enriches the existing knowledge on CVD risk prediction and contributes to improved patient outcomes and reduced CVD-related morbidity and mortality.
